# Log Anomaly Detection with AI

This project implements a lightweight anomaly detection system for system logs using machine learning. It demonstrates how AI can enhance traditional IT monitoring by automatically identifying suspicious or irregular log eventsâ€”useful for early warning systems, intrusion detection, and infrastructure monitoring.

## Overview

- Parses and processes system log files (e.g., Linux `auth.log`, HDFS logs)
- Extracts features using TF-IDF or custom encoding
- Applies machine learning models (e.g., Isolation Forest) for anomaly detection
- Displays results via a simple Streamlit-based web interface

## Use Cases

- IT security monitoring
- Log event summarization and filtering
- SOC analyst tooling enhancement
- AI-based alert triaging

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Scikit-learn (placeholder)
- Pandas / NumPy
- Streamlit (UI potentially)
- Regex-based log parsing
